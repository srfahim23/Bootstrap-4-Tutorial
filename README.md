# Boostrap 5 vs. Boostrap 3 & 4
This tutorial follows Boostrap 4, which was relesed in 2018, as an upgrade to Boostrap 3, with new components, faster stylesheetc, more responsiveness, etc.

Boostrap 5 (relesed 2021) is the newest version of Boostrap; It suppors the letest, stable releses of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported.

The main different betwee Boostrap 5 and Boostrap 3 & 4, is the Boostrap 5 has switched to Javascrip instead of jQuery.

Note: Boostrap 3 and Boostrap 4 is still supported by the team for critical bugfixes and documentation changes, and it is perfectly safee to continue to use them. However, new features will NOT be added to them.
